First Progressive App Demo.

This guide will show you how to get up and running with Workbox to route common requests for a web page and demonstrate how to cache using a common strategy.

Since most websites contain CSS, JavaScript and images, let‚Äôs look at how we can cache and serve these files using a service worker and Workbox.

Create and Register a Service Worker File

Before we can use Workbox, we need to create a service worker file and register it to our website.

Start by creating a file called sw.js at the root of your site and add a console message to the file (This is so we can see it load).

console.log('Hello from sw.js');

In your web page register your new service worker file like so:

<script>
// Check that service workers are registered
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Use the window load event to keep the page load performant
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');
  });
}
</script>

This tells the browser this is the service worker to use for site.

If you refresh your page you'll see the log from your service worker file.


Looking in the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù tab in Chrome DevTools you should see your service worker registered.

Now that we have a service worker registered, let‚Äôs look at how we can use Workbox.

Importing Workbox

To start using Workbox you just need to import the workbox-sw.js file in your service worker.

Change your service worker so that it has the following importScripts() call.

importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/3.2.0/workbox-sw.js');

if (workbox) {
  console.log(`Yay! Workbox is loaded üéâ`);
} else {
  console.log(`Boo! Workbox didn't load üò¨`);
}

With this you should see the ‚ÄúYay‚Äù message so we know that Workbox is officially loaded in our service worker.

Now we can start using Workbox.
Using Workbox

One of Workbox‚Äôs primary features is it‚Äôs routing and caching strategy modules. It allows you to listen for requests from your web page and determine if and how that request should be cached and responded to.

Let‚Äôs add a cache fallback to our JavaScript files. The easiest way to do this is to register a route with Workbox that will match any ‚Äú.js‚Äù files that are requested, which we can do with a regular expression:

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('.*\.js'),
  ‚Ä¶
);

This tells Workbox that when a request is made, it should see if the regular expression matches part of the URL, and if it does, do something with that request. For this guide, that ‚Äúdo something‚Äù is going to be passing the request through one of Workbox‚Äôs caching strategies.

If we want our JavaScript files to come from the network whenever possible, but fallback to the cached version if the network fails, we can use the ‚Äúnetwork first‚Äù strategy to achieve this.

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('.*\.js'),
  workbox.strategies.networkFirst()
);

Add this code to your service worker and refresh the page. If your web page has JavaScript files in it, you should see some logs similar to this:

Example console logs from routing a JavaScript file.

Workbox has routed the request for any ‚Äú.js‚Äù files and used the network first strategy to determine how to respond to the request. You can look in the caches of DevTools to check that the request has actually been cached.

Example of a JavaScript file being cached.

Workbox provides a few caching strategies that you can use. For example, your CSS could be served from the cache first and updated in the background or your images could be cached and used until it‚Äôs a week old, after which it‚Äôll need updating.

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  // Cache CSS files
  /.*\.css/,
  // Use cache but update in the background ASAP
  workbox.strategies.staleWhileRevalidate({
    // Use a custom cache name
    cacheName: 'css-cache',
  })
);

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  // Cache image files
  /.*\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|svg|gif)/,
  // Use the cache if it's available
  workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({
    // Use a custom cache name
    cacheName: 'image-cache',
    plugins: [
      new workbox.expiration.Plugin({
        // Cache only 20 images
        maxEntries: 20,
        // Cache for a maximum of a week
        maxAgeSeconds: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60,
      })
    ],
  })
);
